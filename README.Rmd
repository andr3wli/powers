# powers

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an R package that gives `sqrt` some friends by providing other power functions. The `purrr` package is used under the hood, so that either an atomic vector or a list can be input.
## Installation

You can install `powers` from GitHub via:

``` r
devtools::install_github("andr3wli/powers")
```

## Example

See the vignette for more extensive use, but here's an example:

```{r example}
# library(powers)
# reciprocal(2)
# cube(list(1, 4, 5))
```
